# W241-Make-18-Experiment

Make18 is a game similar to Make24 and was used as a task in a causal experiment to test the effects of incentive-related messaging on a problem-solving task.

Subjects were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 290) and data were collected using Qualtrics.

The Qualtrics survey (includes the Make18 game) can be attempted here: https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2abb8B3P27autUO.

W241_Final_Project_Notebook.ipynb contains the code for loading the raw data in the Data folder, cleaning the data, EDA, and analyses.
